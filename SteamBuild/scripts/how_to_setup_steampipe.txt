- Download the SteamWorks SDK
- Copy the ContentBuilder directory to volo_airsport/SteamBuild
- From the SteamBuild directory run ./builder/steamcmd.exe from the command-line. This is a one time setup step.
- To build the app and upload it make sure you created builds in Unity and placed them in the volo_airsport/Build directory.

- (Mac only) Run the ContentPrep application that same with the Steamworks SDK and use it to prepare your content for Mac. 
  This tools makes sure file permissions of the build are set correctly.
  When the ContentPrep app asks where to store the prepped files set it to 'Build/mac_prepped', this is where the Steam build script will search for files.
- Then run the following command from the command-line interface:
  (Windows) PS C:\Users\frank\projects\my_projects\volo_airsport\SteamBuild> .\builder\steamcmd.exe +login ramjet_anvil_build password_goes_here +run_app_build_http ..\scripts\app_build_329190.vdf +quit
  (Mac OS X) SteamBuild> ./builder/steamcmd.exe +login ramjet_anvil_build password_goes_here +run_app_build_http ../../../../scripts/app_build_329190.vdf +quit
  Due to a bug in SteamSDK 1.31 we need to add '../../../../'
